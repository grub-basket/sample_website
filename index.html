      <h2>Quotations</h2>

         <p>
           In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
           Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
         </p>
         <p>
           <blockquote  style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #fafafa;">
             <p>
               <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
               <br>
               â€”Abraham Lincoln
             </p>
           </blockquote>
         </p>

    <h2>Something useful</h2>

      <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em> technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning techiincal sophistication,probably more.
